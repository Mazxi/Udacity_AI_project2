# Flower Image Classifier Using Pytorch.

This project is the my second project in the Artificial intelligence nano degree program and is a prerequiste to graduate.

## Main files in this repository are;
* `flower_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for developing the flower image classifier
* `train.py` : This contains the functions and codes needed to train and save the model
* `predict.py` : This contains functions and codes needed to load the saved model and predict the category the flower belongs to using tge loaded model.
* `workspace_util` : This is a contains utility functions for `train.py` and `predict.py`

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a flower image classifier that can predict the category of a flower that is in an image when the image of a flower is passed to it.

The project is divided into two sections;
The first section is divided into five tasks;

a. loading and pre-processing the data

b. training the image classifier using a network architecture such as vgg16 or densenet161

c. Saving and then loading the model into the jupyter notebook.

d. Pre-precessing the test set to be predicted

e. Predicting the actual category the flower in the image falls into

The second section was divided into two tasks

a. Training the model and saving in `train.py`

b. Loading the saved model and predicting in `predict.py`

## python libraries

* json
* PIL
